    <h2>Welcome to Tips on Selecting the Right Health Insurance</h2>
    <p>Deductibles and Ice Cream Cones:<br>

        Choosing a health insurance plan is a bit like buying ice cream. You have to decide on the flavor (plan type) and how big of a cone (deductible) you're willing to tackle.<br>
        "Preventive" Pays Off:<br>
        
        Many health insurance plans cover preventive services at no cost to you. It's like getting a bonus for staying healthy!<br>
        Cobra Isn't a Snake:<br>
        
        COBRA is not a venomous snake but rather a law that allows you to temporarily keep your employer-sponsored health insurance coverage after you leave your job.<br>
        Networks are Like Social Circles:<br>
        
        Health insurance plans often have networks of doctors and hospitals. It's like choosing friends wisely: stay in-network for lower costs!<br>
        Premiums: The Monthly Membership Fee:<br>
        
        Think of your health insurance premium as a monthly club membership fee. You pay to be part of the health coverage club.<br>
        Co-payments: Your Health VIP Pass:<br>
        
        Co-payments are like having a VIP pass for health services: a set fee you pay each time you visit a doctor or fill a prescription.<br>
        Coinsurance is Cost Sharing:<br>
        
        Coinsurance is a tag-team effort between you and your insurance company. You share a percentage of the costs after you've met your deductible.<br>
        Out-of-Pocket Maximum: Your Safety Net:<br>
        
        Your out-of-pocket maximum is the superhero cape of health insurance: it saves you from paying more once you've hit a certain spending limit.</p>
